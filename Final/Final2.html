<h1>History Of Nintendo Handhelds</h1>
<ol>
<li><h2>Game And Watch</h2></li>

<p>The Game And Watch was Nintendo's first attempt at making portable game consoles. These were a series of different games that each had only one game on them and they were all "high score" type games. These were also all devices that could tell the time as well which is why the "watch" part of their name is there.</p>

<li><h2>GameBoy</h2></li>
<div class="console">

<p>The original Gameboy was Nintendo's first handheld which could play multiple games and used interchangeable cartrages. It had a screen that required outside light to be seen. The original Gameboy got a couple of revisions including the Gameboy Pocket,which had a smaller form factor and was easier to fit into a pocket. The Gameboy Light, which had a lit screen however was not released outside of Japan. Nintendo also says that the Gameboy Color is a revision of the original gameboy as it had the same restrictions as the original however, it added a color screen and some games that could only be played on the new hardware.</p>

<li><h2>Gameboy Advance</h2></li>
<div class="console">

<p>The Gameboy Advance is what Nintendo calls the true successor to the original Gameboy. This iteration could play every single Gameboy and Gameboy Color game that released as well as being able to play its own games which were much more intensive due to the new technology inside of it. The Gameboy Advance also still had a screen that required outside light. The Gameboy Advance SP was the first update to the Advance. This upgrade had a fontlit screen with a backlit version that came out later. The only other iteration came after the Nintendo DS released. The Gameboy Micro was a very small form factor gameboy advance that could only play Gameboy Advance games and still had a backlit screen.</p>
</div>
<li><h2>Nintendo DS</h2></li>
<div class="console">

<p>The Nintendo DS was nintendo's first innovation in the handheld space. The DS had two screens and almost every single game that released on the system utilized both of the screens. The console also had significantly more power than the GBA and could play GBA games. The DS lite was the first successor which streamlined the design. The DSI came next and removed the support for Gameboy Advance games but added a different home screen with two cameras and an online shop that could be used to buy some games digitally on the console.

<li><h2>Nintendo 3DS</h2></li>
<div class="console">

<p>The Nintendo 3DS continued the trend of Nintendo putting new ideas into their consoles. The 3DS had a stereoscopic 3D screen that could show 3D images without the need for 3D glasses. The 3DS could play DS games as well as its own games. The sucessor to the 3DS would first be the 2DS. This is a 3DS without a clamshell design and without the stereoscopic 3D effect. After the 2DS, the New 3DS and the New 2DS would release. These were slightly upgraded consoles with bigger screens, slightly more power, and a small C stick. These consoles released closer to the end of the 3DS' lifetime.

<li><h2>Nintendo Switch</h2></li>

<p>The Nintendo Switch was the first Nintendo handheld that also acted as a home console. The Switch could be brought wherever you wanted while also being able to play docked on a TV. It has detachable controllers and a screen tablet that can dock and display onto the TV. The first update to the Switch was the Switch lite. This console did not have removable controllers and could not dock into a TV. These were made for more travel playing. The Nintendo Switch OLED was the 2nd update to the system. With an OLED screen, a better kickstand, better speakers, and a larger screen, this update added a lot to the handheld expierence of the Nintendo Switch while also keeping the ability to play on the TV with ethernet built into the dock.</p>
