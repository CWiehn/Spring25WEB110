<p>Some of the earliest work that I have done with technology was reshelling my Gameboy Advance SP. Doing this gave me a feel for taking things appart and tinkering with them. I also learned many different ways in which taking it appart could harm the electronics inside and the ways in which the components worked.</p>

<li><h2>Soldering work</h2></li>
<div class="work">

<p>Soldering is something that I largely learned from watching YouTube repair videos and that I taught myself while taking a repair class in highschool. I have successfully replaced multiple batteries in older video games as well as soldering a small wire when I modded one of my Gameboys. During the repair class I practiced soldering USB-C chargeing ports and successfully replaced multiple.</p>

<div class="work">
<img src="code.jpg" alt="A picture of a coding assignment for my college class."></img>
<p>I took a coding class in highschool and learned some Python during the class. I have also taken a html and CSS class in college that has taught me a lot about coding and how to make different websites. I also coded this entire website myself.</p>

<li><h2>Built Computers</h2></li>
<div class="work">
<img src="computer.jpg" alt="A picture of the first computer that I ever built"></img>
<p>Once I got my first job, the first thing that I used a lot of money on was building a PC. I learned about all of the parts and put them together. Since then I have built two more a few years after eachother. The second one was for my older sister and the second for by best friend. I have also helped other friends figure out what parts they need and can afford for their own PC builds.</p>

<div class="work">
<img src="repair.jpg" alt="A picture of something that I have repaired."></img>
<p>I have repaired many of my own electronics as well as my friend's electronics. I have replayed Nintendo Switch Joycon sticks, buttons, and more. I have also bought broken consoles off of Ebay and fixed them. These were a Wii U and a Nintendo Switch Lite.</p>
